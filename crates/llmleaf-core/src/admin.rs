//! The read-only admin / observability surface, lifted off the HTTP transport.
//!
//! SOUL.md "Architecture soul": the admin GETs (`/admin/routes|health|keys`) are observability only —
//! there is no mutation path (P5/P9: node-local, read-only, pulled-not-pushed). Historically this logic
//! lived inside the axum handlers, reachable only through a real listener. Here it is a transport-
//! agnostic trait on [`AppState`]: production drives it from the axum handlers (real networking); the
//! zero-dependency simulation drives it directly, with no axum/HTTP/networking, and cross-checks every
//! view against an independent reference model.
//!
//! Every method is a pure read of node-local state (config base + last-pulled cache). It is entirely
//! OFF the consumer hot path (chat/embeddings/…), so trait dispatch here adds no hot-path cost (P1) —
//! and it is implemented on the concrete [`AppState`], so even the admin handlers dispatch statically
//! (no `Box`/`Arc<dyn>` is introduced on any request path).
